  introParagraph: `AI in code review is revolutionizing how developers ensure high-quality, maintainable, and secure software. Traditional reviews often slow down delivery and rely heavily on human judgment. With AI-powered tools, teams can identify bugs faster, maintain coding standards, and accelerate release cycles. This guide explores how automated code review improves quality and speed, its real-world use cases, and best practices for implementation. By the end, you'll see why integrating AI into the code review process is essential for modern software development.`,

  section1Title: 'How Automated Code Review Works',
  section1Text: `AI in code review leverages machine learning models trained on massive codebases. These tools scan new code submissions, highlight potential issues, and provide feedback aligned with coding standards. Machine learning models are trained on millions of lines of historical code changes, bugs, and fixes to understand patterns of good and bad coding practice better than any single human could.`,

  section2Title: 'The Need for Speed and Accuracy',
  section2Content: `The demand for faster feature delivery often conflicts with the need for thorough, error-free code. Manual code reviews are prone to:
- **Inconsistency:** Review standards vary between team members.
- **Slowness:** Reviewers become bottlenecks, delaying merges.
- **Burnout:** Repetitive, tedious checks lead to human error.
AI tools provide instant, objective analysis, freeing human reviewers to focus on complex architectural decisions and logic flaws, where human intuition is truly needed.`,
